T Ray-finned fishes , and most remaining groups of vertebrates , have internal skeletons of calcified , rigid bone rather than flexible cartilage .<1/><0/>
T Some oomycetes are coenocytes , which means they have many nuclei enclosed in a single plasma membrane .<1/><0/>
T An action potential arriving at an axon terminal causes it to release chemical messenger molecules called neurotransmitters .<1/><0/>
U Progress through the cell cycle depends on the activities of cyclin-dependent kinases , or Cdk ’ s .<1/><0/>
T The organisms in Archaea and Bacteria are collectively called prokaryotes because they have in common a prokaryotic cell organization .<1/><0/>
T During the Permian period , the continents coalesced completely into the supercontinent Pangaea .<1/><0/>
U In contrast to mosaic development , the loss of some cells during cleavage in regulative development does not affect the developing embryo , because the remaining cells compensate for the loss .<1/><0/>
U The generative cell , meanwhile , has undergone one mitotic division and cytokinesis to produce two haploid sperm cells ( Figure 38.6 , steps 1 and 2 ) .<1/><0/>
U The rest—about 11 liters—is the interstitial fluid that bathes every cell of the body ( Figure 40.1 ) .<1/><0/>
T In a behavior known as coprophagy , these species reingest the cecal feces directly from the anus so they | HOW IS THE FLOW OF NUTRIENTS CONTROLLED AND REGULATED ?<1/><0/>
U The plants providing and receiving the pollen were the parental generation , designated P .<1/><0/>
P 1119 53.6 The fruitless Gene ( A ) Male fruit flies display stereotypic , species-specific courtship behavior .<1/><0/>
T Instead of extracting ESCs from blastocysts , they make induced pluripotent stem cells ( iPS cells ) from skin cells .<1/><0/>
U Production of fruits is another of their unique characteristics .<1/><0/>
T Important components of any regulatory system are the sensors that provide the feedback information to be compared with the internal set point .<1/><0/>
T Pair rule genes divide the embryo into units of two segments each .<1/><0/>
T The larval form known as a trochophore moves by beating a band of cilia ( see Figure 31.11A ) .<1/><0/>
U Another feature of the voltage-gated Na channels is that once they open and close , they have a refractory period of 1 to 2 milliseconds during which they can not open again .<1/><0/>
P 39.16 A Signal Transduction Pathway in Response to Drought Stress Acclimation to drought stress begins in the root with the production of the hormone abscisic acid .<1/><0/>
T The first two questions refer to the proximate causes of behavior : the immediate genetic , physiological , neurological , and developmental mechanisms that determine how an individual is behaving at a particular time .<1/><0/>
T Oxaloacetate is converted to malate , which diffuses out of the mesophyll cells and into the bundle sheath cells ( see Figure 10.18B ) , located in the interior of the leaf .<1/><0/>
T Hormones are chemical signals that are released by certain types of cells and that influence the activities of other cells at a distance .<1/><0/>
U One extraction effort began with the hypothalami from 270,000 sheep and yielded only 1 milligram of purified thyrotropin-releasing hormone ( TRH ) .<1/><0/>
U The simplest example of associative learning is the conditioned reflex , described by the Russian physiologist Ivan Pavlov .<1/><0/>
U Soils have living and nonliving components ( Figure 36.4 ) .<1/><0/>
U Effector cells carry out the attack on the antigen .<1/><0/>
T There are four categories of biologically important carbohydrates : Monosaccharides ( mono , “ one ” ; saccharide , “ sugar ” ) , such as glucose , ribose , and fructose , are simple sugars .<1/><0/>
U Photoautotrophs perform photosynthesis .<1/><0/>
T However , the enzyme amylase is secreted by the salivary glands and mixed with food as it is chewed .<1/><0/>
U Fermentation does not involve O ( it is anaerobic ) .<1/><0/>
T The product of this cycle is glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate ( G 3P ) , which is a 3-carbon sugar phosphate , also called triose phosphate : In a typical leaf , five-sixths of the G3P is recycled into RuBP .<1/><0/>
T At the next level are primary consumers — the herbivores that dine on the primary producers .<1/><0/>
