W The generalized flower in Figure 29.5 has functional megasporangia and microsporangia ; such flowers are referred to as perfect ( or hermaphroditic ) .<1/><0/>
T This covalent addition is catalyzed by the enzyme DNA methyltransferase and , in mammals , usually occurs in C residues that are adjacent to G residues .<1/><0/>
U be floral meristems , each of which gives rise to a flower .<1/><0/>
W With a slight delay , it generates action potentials that are conducted to the ventricles via the bundle of His , which consists of modified cardiac muscle fibers that do not contract .<1/><0/>
U Some chlorophytes have a haplontic life cycle , in which a multicellular haploid individual produces gametes that fuse to form a zygote .<1/><0/>
U In the two-part body of chelicerates , the head bears two pairs of appendages modified to form mouthparts .<1/><0/>
T The result is an electric charge difference— a membrane potential —across the plasma membrane , with the inside of the cell negative to the outside .<1/><0/>
W If an animal takes in too little food to meet its energy requirements , it is undernourished and must start metabolizing some of the molecules of its own body .<1/><0/>
